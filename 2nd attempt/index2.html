                    <h3>Then + Now</h3>
                    <p>I'm born in Taiwan and have lived in China, US, Italy throughout the past.<br>
                    Business/Finance has been the major field during education and career since highschool. <br><br>
                    May 2021, I hit the 3.5 year mark on my job at Citibank and was ready to switch it up. Just about the same time Taiwan began lockdown as COVID-19 outbreak widened.<br>
                    I thought it was be the perfect timing to learn some programming, and, to keep myself mentally healthy.<br><br>
                    In fact, first time I ever touched base on programming was the Python classes at NTU, however, I stopped as the classes ended.<br>
                    I did more research this time and looked at the bigger picture of coding,l and, decided to self learn Javascript!<br>
                    This resume is the first project I'm making, I hope it's alright!</p>
